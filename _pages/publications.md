Ensembling differentiable process-based and data-driven models with diverse meteorological forcing datasets to advance streamflow simulation. **Hydrology and Earth System Sciences**, 29(23), 6829–6861.

>This study explores how combining different model types improves streamflow predictions, especially in data-sparse scenarios. By integrating two highly accurate models with distinct mechanisms and leveraging multiple meteorological datasets, we highlight their unique strengths and set new accuracy benchmarks across spatiotemporal conditions. Our findings enhance the understanding of how diverse models and multi-source data can be effectively used to improve hydrological predictions.

>This study tackles a common challenge in hydrological modeling: errors that arise when transferring model parameters across spatial scales (e.g., from local to regional scales). We propose a deep learning–based approach that integrates scale conversion and pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) directly within a single model. Traditional methods separate these steps and often introduce errors due to mismatched scales. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) learns the mapping from static soil/landscape attributes to hydrological parameters across scales, automatically handling the scale discrepancy. This integrated strategy reduces errors in cross-scale parameter transfer and improves the quality and robustness of soil moisture predictions, as shown in both synthetic and real-world tests.

>In this study, we developed a new family of soil water retention models—mathematical formulas that describe how water is held in soil at different moisture levels. Soil water retention curves are fundamental for understanding water movement, plant water availability, and soil-water interactions in hydrology and agriculture. Traditionally, existing equations sometimes struggle to fit data well across the full range of soil moisture, especially near very dry or very wet conditions. We proposed a flexible set of models based on sigmoid functions that can more accurately and smoothly represent soil water retention across the entire moisture range. These models improve on existing ones by offering better fit quality, fewer fitting issues, and a consistent mathematical structure that makes them easier to apply in hydrologic and environmental modeling. Our results show that this new family of models performs well across diverse soil types and can help improve predictions of soil water behavior in hydrologic simulations.

Comparison of the use of a physical-based model with data assimilation and machine learning methods for simulating soil water dynamics. ***Journal of Hydrology***, 584, 124692. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124692](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124692)  
>In this work, we compared a traditional physically-based soil water model with data assimilation to several machine learning models for simulating how soil moisture changes over time. We found that the physically-based model (solving Richards’ equation with data assimilation) was more sensitive to uncertainties in soil conditions and boundary settings, while the machine learning models were less affected by these physical assumptions. However, the machine learning models had difficulty capturing sharp peaks and troughs in soil moisture. Overall, each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and machine learning offers robustness and lower computational cost, whereas the physical model’s performance depends on good prior information about soil properties.
