Hi, my name is Peijun Li
=====
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in hydrological science

My research touches on interdisciplinary water science including the analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of soil water and groundwater data. Data are derived from remote sensors, situ observation sites especially via some sensors, and secondary sources. The analytical methods used include statistical approaches and physically-based models.

Prospects
======
1. Discover scale-consistent hydrological theories via multi-scale soil moisture and groundwater data and models;
2. Simulate and predict multi-scale hydrological components more efficiently and effectively
3. Investigate the effects/response of soil moisture and groundwater variation on/to climate change and human activities
