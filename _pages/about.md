Hi, my name is Peijun Li
=====
I'm a Ph.D. in hydrological science, now working in Penn State as post-doctoral scholar

My research touches on interdisciplinary water science including the analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of hydrological data. Data are derived from remote sensors, situ observation sites especially via some sensors, and secondary sources. The analytical methods used include statistical approaches and physically-based models.

Prospects
======
1. Discover scale-consistent hydrological theories via multi-scale soil moisture and groundwater data and models;
2. Simulate and predict multi-scale hydrological components more efficiently and effectively
3. Investigate the effects/response of soil moisture and groundwater variation on/to climate change and human activities
