Hi, my name is Peijun Li
=====
I'm a Ph.D. in hydrological science, now working in Penn State as post-doctoral scholar

My research focuses on analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of hydrological data. The data sources include remote sensing, in-situ observation sites—particularly those equipped with specialized sensors—and secondary datasets. I employ a range of analytical methods, including statistical techniques, physically based models, and hybrid approaches that integrate both.


Prospects
======
1. Develop scale-consistent hydrological theories by integrating multi-scale hydrological data and models; 
2. Improve the efficiency and accuracy of simulating and predicting hydrological components across scales; 
3. Investigate the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological variability, as well as the hydrological system’s responses to these external drivers.
