CV  

# About Me
My studies focus on the analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of soil water and groundwater data. Data are derived from remote sensors, situ observation sites especially via some sensors, and secondary sources. The analytical methods used include statistical approaches and physically-based models.
# Education
MSc & Ph.D. candidate in School of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering, Wuhan University, China (2018-present).  
Visiting student at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research â€“ UFZ, Germany (2022-present).
# Research interests
* Data Science
* Data Assimilation
* Neural Network Model
* Time Series Analysis
* Intelligent monitoring
* Remote Sensing
* Model Development
* Multi-Scale
* Hydroinformatics
* Soil moisture
* Groundwater
* Earth system simulation
* Earth system observation  

# Skills
Python; Matlab; R; Fortran; Shell; and Google Earth Engine; data assimilation methods; statistical analysis methods; machine learning methods; Hydrus; MODFLOW; soil water balance model; HBV; W3RA; Multiscale Parameter Regionalization (MPR)
# Prospects
To discover scale-consistent hydrological theories via cross-scale soil moisture and groundwater data and models;  
To simulate and predict cross-scale soil moisture and groundwater more efficiently and effectively;
